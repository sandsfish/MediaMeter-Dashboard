# MediaMeter Dashboard

MediaMeter is a suite of tools built on top of the MediaCloud online news database. A 
number of tools make up the suite, all driven by a query you author to specify media 
sources, a date range, and some keywords.

The Dashboard shows simplified widgets to give a quick overview of an issue's 
media coverage and let users identify interesting trends for more in-depth analysis.
